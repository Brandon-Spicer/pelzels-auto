        <p>Spent the night broken down in Naches at Circle K, until the owner of
          Pelzel's showed up and literally RESCUED me and my son (and our puppy
          Benji). Had one of his guys tow us to his shop, found the issue and had
          us on our way, running better than ever, in under an hour! Best service
          I've ever had from any shop!</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-2">
        <p>Honestly the best experience I have ever had at a mechanics! I was on
          a road trip through Washington in my RV when I started having engine
          problems and broke down. I called Pelzel’s and they got back to me that day and said if I
          can make it bring it in today or tomorrow! I can never find a mechanic
          that's willing to look at it that fast. . . They did amazing work on the RV and she's running like a
          dream and the customer service was unbeatable!</p>
        <!-- <p>All in all, great experience and would highly recommend!</p> -->

      <div class="col-3">
        <p>I've had so many problems finding a good, honest place to take my car
          to for repairs. Those stopped when I went to Pelzel's. I can always
          count on Clint giving me an honest diagnosis at a reasonable price.
          No up selling, no games. If you need a great mechanic, I highly
          recommend taking your car here.</p>
